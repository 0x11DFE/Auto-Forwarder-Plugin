## ‚ú® Features

* **Seamless Auto-Updater:**
    * Get notified directly in the app when a new version is available on GitHub Releases.
    * View the official changelog in a pop-up dialog before updating.
    * Update with a single click‚Äîno manual downloads or installs required.
    * Includes both automatic background checks and a manual check button.

* **Two Powerful Forwarding Modes:**
    * **Copy Mode:** Sends a brand new message, making it look like you sent it yourself. This mode enables:
        * **Perfect Formatting:** Preserves **bold**, *italic*, `monospace`, ~~strikethrough~~, ||spoilers||, and [hyperlinks](https://telegram.org).
        * **Reply Quoting:** Automatically recreates the replied-to message as a visual quote block.
    * **Header Mode (Simulated Forward):** Copies the message and prepends a custom, clickable "Forwarded from..." header, linking to the original author and chat.

* **Keyword & Regex Filtering:**
    * Create rules that only forward messages or media captions containing specific keywords or matching a regular expression.
    * Features a case-insensitive, fallback search for invalid regex patterns.

* **Advanced Content Filtering:**
    * For each rule, precisely select which types of content to forward (Text, Photos, Videos, Documents, Stickers, etc.).
    * Filter messages based on the author (Users, Bots, or your own Outgoing messages).

* **Intelligent Buffering & Anti-Spam:**
    * **Album Handling:** Automatically waits to collect all photos/videos in a gallery before sending them together as a single album.
    * **Media Deferral:** Includes a safety net for large or slow-to-download media, retrying to ensure files are forwarded reliably.
    * **Anti-Spam Firewall:** A built-in rate-limiter prevents a single user from flooding your destination chat with rapid messages.
